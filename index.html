    <h1>Why does God <br>Let Bad Things Happen?</h1>
    <p>A possible explanation...</p>
  </div>
  <p class="intro">What if every soul in this world was actually the same soul in different stages of development. It would lead to all different kinds of different connotations about how to react to people..</p>
  <h2>What-if: Church of one soul.</h2>
  <p>  Re-incarnated 12 people which became 10 billion. Die-off down to 4 billion back up to 10 billion. Variations in population# - how to acccount for this?</p>
  <p> This is a what-if not an i know. Don't accept it as the gospel it's a what if.
  What-if: Reincarnation into another body: ancient history of peoples believing this.
  What happens when there's more people than in beginning? Where did all these souls come from?
  How do you account for more people ? Where did they reincarnate from?
  Started with Adam and eve....</p>
  <p>My what-if, of one soul, it's like a quantum computer it can apparently get information from other universes, quantum computer can get info from past and future, I think it's possible that when our soul leaves the body: aka death: it goes to some kinda holding place, wait there and decide what to do next, or it goes to another body right away, then it can go to the future, past or present and live the next life. If that's the case, any slot of life, of a person that can exist, 10k yrs ago birth, can be filled once with one soul, (the same soul,) and that soul would live its life and learn, so there would be 2 diff tracts of learning available, if a person could somehow access past life information, and seee it /xp it again, then they would have knowledge from that past life. 2 diff tracts of info accumulated knowledge of life learned by that soul, possibly all knowledge of all lives but that would be tedious to run thru but it would be stored somewhere, because lives exist so they have to be stored in time. Knowledge of life, humam, bird, w/e , knowledge of birth to death plus instinctual knowledge, we think that instincts come from dna. Birdst learn, and they have instincts. 2 forms of knowledge accessible to them. When they die, the knowledge stops with the death, and the soul would take with it the mained learning points of that life. It's hard to say without dying, how much info is accessible. If i had all the knowledge of God and of creation my head would explode! I don't think a soul is that much differemt, i thnk it's probable that it doesn't contain all knowledge but may contain main points. 9.22</p>
